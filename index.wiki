Caveats:

 * The empeg allows a child item to appear multiple times in a given parent.
 * These are _not_ symlinks; they're sorta hard links.
 * They are not allowed to have different names -- the link is by FID, not by (name, FID).

Milestone 1:

 * [X] Display a list of all the tunes and playlists on a player.
 * [X] Recursively display the playlists and tunes on a player.
 * [X] Actually talk to a real player. Using Hijack.
 * [ ] Delete a playlist, including all of the content.
 * [ ] Write that back to the player.
 * [ ] Upload a new item; attach it to an arbitrary playlist.

Not Scheduled:
 
 * [ ] Editing config.ini settings.
 * [ ] Ability to change playlist order.
 * [ ] Editing playlist settings (pickn, etc.)
 * [ ] Time synchronisation -- somehow. FTP SITE EXEC, maybe?
 * [ ] Don't forget to update the seq_num in the config.ini file.
